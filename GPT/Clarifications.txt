[[GPT]]
Could you please clarify a few details so I can provide a trustworthy and comprehensive answer:

1. What is the target application domain (e.g., surveillance, wildlife monitoring, traffic analysis)?
2. Are you working with RGB video, thermal, or multispectral data?
3. What frame rate and resolution do your drone video streams typically have?
4. Do you have constraints related to computation (e.g., real-time inference on edge devices)?
5. Are you focused on existing methods, or are you looking to develop a new approach?

This will help tailor the recommendations and research direction appropriately.

[[Our Response]]
1. There is no specific target domain.
2. Drones will be equipped with RGB video cameras, but can be equipped with other cameras and sensors as techniques require.
3. There is no specific frame rate requirement
4. No constraints on computation
5. I am focused on reviewing existing methods.
