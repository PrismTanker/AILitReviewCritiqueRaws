# Raw Literature Reviews Produced using AI Tools.

This repository holds supplementary material for our paper: "Critiquing AI Surveys With A Case Study On Temporal Features For Trustworthy Object Detection and Tracking".

Each tool produced two literature reviews, prompted using the two research questions explored in this paper respectively. Each review is presented in the appropriately named PDF under the corresponding tool.

All PDFs were exported from AI tools directly. The exception to this was consensus, which only offered
raw text export. Formatting was recreated within this raw text using Markdown and exported to PDF manually. All exports were conducted immediately upon review generation.
